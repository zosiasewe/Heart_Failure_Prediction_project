# ❤️ Heart Failure Prediction Project

A machine learning project to predict the risk of heart failure using patient data like age, BMI, blood pressure, and more.

📊 **Dataset**:  
[Heart Failure Prediction – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

---

## 🔧 Project Status

Currently in the **training phase**. Data preprocessing, analysis, and model building are in progress.

---

## 📁 Planned Steps

- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection  
- Model training & evaluation  
- (Optional) REST API for predictions  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- (Optional) Flask or FastAPI  

---

## 📌 Goal

Build a classification model to accurately predict heart failure risk and explore how features influence the prediction.
